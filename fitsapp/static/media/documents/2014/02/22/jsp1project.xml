<task-node name="textImageDisplay~frame_4.1~The quiet blonde-haired girl smiled at your comment, saying that it is nice to see someone from overseas appreciate their culture. You introduce yourself and she does the same. Her name is Kotomine Suzuna and she also came from Tokyo. Furthermore, she said that she is also studying in Tokyo University. By that time, the floats have started to move and the parade has already begun. As the drumbeats filled the streets with noise, you strained to hear what Kotomine-san is saying. When she said a remark about you, you didn’t hear it properly so you asked if she can repeat what she said.">

<task-node name="textImageDisplay~frame_4.2~The blonde-haired girl frowned. She seemed hurt and annoyed by what you said.

You also introduce yourself to her, saying sorry again as you realized that you were rude not to introduce yourself first.  She looks as if she’s going to ignore it but after some thought, she accepted it. Introducing herself, you now know that her name is Kotomine Suzuna. You smile and point at the stall. The stall has a game of goldfish scooping and you said that you’ll make up for your rudeness by catching a lot for Kotomine-san. Kotomine-san laughed, saying that it reminds her of her childhood.">

You introduce yourself, saying sorry for being rude since you didn’t introduce yourself first. She said it was no problem and also introduced herself. Her name is Yamamoto Sakura. Yamamoto-san was surprised when the drumbeats started signaling the start of the parade. You smiled at Yamamoto-san for being startled which gained a pout and a friendly “it’s-not-good-to-laugh-at-people” look from her.">

You see a stall with a vendor cooking something with a really pleasant aroma. You turn to the girl and apologized for your rude comment adding that you just compared the floats to last year’s since you also attended the festival last year. That’s when you introduced yourself and she also did. Her name was Yamamoto Sakura. Yamamoto-san smiled. To make up for your mistake, you decide to take her to a food stall you saw a while ago. The vendor was selling takoyaki and you bought enough for both of you. Yamamoto-san doesn’t want you to pay for hers but you insisted until she gave in.

After a few stories, he apologized for not introducing himself. You laugh saying that you also did not introduce yourself. That starts your acquaintance. His name is Moritake Yusuke. The parade continues towards the city square. Both of you walk to it and discovered a lot of stalls dealing with goods or entertainment. Moritaka-san smiled excitedly and pointed at a stall with a shooting game. He paid to play the game and aimed with the toy gun. With one quick pull of the trigger, Moritaka-san took down a large brown teddy bear. After that, he presented it to you as an apology for his rudeness a while ago.
